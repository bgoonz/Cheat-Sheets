### Rendering

---

---

#### Rendering (ES5)

```js
ReactDOM.render(
  React.createElement(Link, { name: "HackHall.com" }),
  document.getElementById("menu")
);
```

---

---

#### Rendering (ES5+JSX)

```js
ReactDOM.render(<Link name="HackHall.com" />, document.getElementById("menu"));
```

---

---

### Server-side Rendering

```js
var ReactDOMServer = require("react-dom/server");
ReactDOMServer.renderToString(Link, { name: "HackHall.com" });
ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup(Link, { name: "HackHall.com" });
```

---

---

### Components

---

---

#### ES5

```js
var Link = React.createClass({
  displayName: "Link",
  render: function () {
    return React.createElement(
      "a",
      { className: "btn", title: this.props.name },
      "Click ->",
      this.props.name
    );
  },
});
```

---

---

#### ES5 + JSX

```js
var Link = React.createClass({
  render: function () {
    return (
      <a className="btn" title={this.props.name}>
        Click -> this.props.name
      </a>
    );
  },
});
```

---

---

#### ES6 + JSX

```js
class Link extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <a className="btn" title={this.props.name}>
        Click -> this.props.name
      </a>
    );
  }
}
```

---

### Advanced Components

---

#### Options (ES5)

- `propTypes object`: Type validation in development mode
- `getDefaultProps function()`: object of default props
- `getInitialState function()`: object of the initial state

ES5:

```js
var Link = React.createClass({
  propTypes: { name: React.PropTypes.string },
  getDefaultProps: function () {
    return { initialCount: 0 };
  },
  getInitialState: function () {
    return { count: this.props.initialCount };
  },
  tick: function () {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  },
  render: function () {
    return React.createElement(
      "a",
      {
        className: "btn",
        href: "#",
        title: this.props.name,
        onClick: this.tick.bind(this),
      },
      "Click ->",
      this.props.name ? this.props.name : "webapplog.com",
      " (Clicked: " + this.state.count + ")"
    );
  },
});
```

ES5 + JSX:

```js
var Link = React.createClass({
  propTypes: { name: React.PropTypes.string },
  getDefaultProps: function () {
    return { initialCount: 0 };
  },
  getInitialState: function () {
    return { count: this.props.initialCount };
  },
  tick: function () {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  },
  render: function () {
    return (
      <a
        onClick={this.tick.bind(this)}
        href="#"
        className="btn"
        title={this.props.name}
      >
        Click -> {this.props.name ? this.props.name : "webapplog.com"}
        (Clicked: {this.state.count})
      </a>
    );
  },
});
```

ES6 + JSX:

```js
export class Link extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { count: props.initialCount };
  }
  tick() {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <a
        onClick={this.tick.bind(this)}
        href="#"
        className="btn"
        title={this.props.name}
      >
        Click -> {this.props.name ? this.props.name : "webapplog.com"}
        (Clicked: {this.state.count})
      </a>
    );
  }
}
Link.propTypes = { initialCount: React.PropTypes.number };
Link.defaultProps = { initialCount: 0 };
```

### Lifecycle Events

Modern React lifecycle methods (v16+)

Legacy Lifecycle Events:

- `componentWillMount function()`
- `componentDidMount function()`
- `componentWillReceiveProps function(nextProps)`
- `shouldComponentUpdate function(nextProps, nextState)-> bool`
- `componentWillUpdate function(nextProps, nextState)`
- `componentDidUpdate function(prevProps, prevState)`
- `componentWillUnmount function()`

Sequence of lifecycle events:

Inspired by [http://react.tips](http://react.tips)

---

---

### Special Props

- `key`: Unique identifier for an element to turn arrays/lists into hashes for better performance, e.g., `key={id}`
- `ref`: Reference to an element via `this.refs.NAME`, e.g., `ref="email"` will create `this.refs.email` DOM node or `ReactDOM.findDOMNode(this.refs.email)`
- `style`: Accept an object of styles, instead of a string (immutable since v0.14), e.g., `style={{color: red}}`
- `className`: the HTML `class` attribute, e.g., `className="btn"`
- `htmlFor`: the HTML `for` attribute, e.g., `htmlFor="email"`
- `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`: raw HTML by providing an object with the key `__html`
- `children`: content of the element via `this.props.children`, e.g., `this.props.children[0]`
- `data-NAME`: custom attribute, e.g., `data-tooltip-text="..."`

---

---

### propTypes

Types available under `React.PropTypes`:

- `any`
- `array`
- `bool`
- `element`
- `func`
- `node`
- `number`
- `object`
- `string`

To make required, append `.isRequired`.

More methods:

- `instanceOf(constructor)`
- `oneOf(['News', 'Photos'])`
- `oneOfType([propType, propType])`

---

---

#### Custom Validation

```js
propTypes: {
  customProp: function(props, propName, componentName) {
    if (!/regExPattern/.test(props[propName])) {
      return new Error('Validation failed!');
    }
  }
}
```

---

---

### Component Properties and Methods

Properties:

- `this.refs`: Lists components with a `ref` prop
- `this.props`: Any props passed to an element (immutable)
- `this.state`: State set by setState and getInitialState (muttable) — avoid setting state manually with `this.state=...`
- `this.isMounted`: Flag whether the element has a corresponding DOM node or not

Methods:

- `setState(changes)`: Change state (partially) to `this.state` and trigger re-render
- `replaceState(newState)`: Replace `this.state` and trigger re-render
- `forceUpdate()`: Trigger DOM re-render immediately

---

---

---

**optionalElement: PropTypes.element, You can also declare that a prop is an instance of a class. This uses**

optionalNumber: PropTypes.number,
optionalObject: PropTypes.object,
optionalString: PropTypes.string,
optionalSymbol: PropTypes.symbol,  Anything that can be rendered: numbers, strings, elements or an array

**You can declare that a prop is a specific JS type. By default, these are all optional**

---

```js
ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticNodeStream(element)

import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
MyComponent.propTypes = {
```

> page generator, as stripping away the extra attributes can save some bytes.

> internally, such as data-reactroot. This is useful if you want to use React as a simple static

---

---

**Similar to renderToNodeStream, except this doesn't create extra DOM attributes that React uses**

---

```js
ReactDOMServer.renderToNodeStream(element);
```

---

> request for faster page loads and to allow search engines to crawl your pages for SEO purposes.

**You can use this method to generate HTML on the server and send the markup down on the initial**

---

> The HTML output by this stream is exactly equal to what ReactDOMServer.renderToString would return.

---

---

**Render a React element to its initial HTML. Returns a Readable stream that outputs an HTML string**

---

```js
ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup(element);
```

---

> page generator, as stripping away the extra attributes can save some bytes.

> internally, such as data-reactroot. This is useful if you want to use React as a simple static

---

---

**Similar to renderToString, except this doesn't create extra DOM attributes that React uses**

---

```js
ReactDOMServer.renderToString(element);
```

---

> request for faster page loads and to allow search engines to crawl your pages for SEO purposes.

**You can use this method to generate HTML on the server and send the markup down on the initial**

---

> Render a React element to its initial HTML. React will return an HTML string.

- The ReactDOMServer object enables you to render components to static markup.

---

---

### REACTDOMSERVER

---

---

---

---

```js
ReactDOM.createPortal(child, container);
```

---

---

> the hierarchy of the DOM component.

---

---

**Creates a portal. Portals provide a way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside**

---

```js
ReactDOM.findDOMNode(component);
```

---

> using findDOMNode at all.

> and performing DOM measurements. In most cases, you can attach a ref to the DOM node and avoid

> DOM element. This method is useful for reading values out of the DOM, such as form field values

---

---

**If this component has been mounted into the DOM, this returns the corresponding native browser**

---

```js
ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(container);
```

---

> Returns true if a component was unmounted and false if there was no component to unmount.

> If no component was mounted in the container, calling this function does nothing.

---

---

**Remove a mounted React component from the DOM and clean up its event handlers and state**

---

```js
ReactDOM.hydrate(element, container[, callback]);
```

---

> by ReactDOMServer. React will attempt to attach event listeners to the existing markup.

---

---

**Same as render(), but is used to hydrate a container whose HTML contents were rendered**

---

```js
ReactDOM.render(element, container[, callback]);
```

---

> to the component (or returns null for stateless components).

> Render a React element into the DOM in the supplied container and return a reference

- The react-dom package provides DOM-specific methods that can be used at the top level of
- your app and as an escape hatch to get outside of the React model if you need to.
- Most of your components should not need to use this module.

---

---

### REACT.DOM

---

---

---

---

```js
component.forceUpdate(callback);
```

---

> Normally you should try to avoid all uses of forceUpdate() and only read from this.props and this.state in render().

> If your render() method depends on some other data, you can tell React that the component needs re-rendering by calling forceUpdate().

---

---

**By default, when your component's state or props change, your component will re-render**

---

```js
Component.defaultProps = {
  color: "blue",
};
component = new Component();
```

---

> This is used for undefined props, but not for null props.

> Can be defined as a property on the component class itself, to set the default props for the class.

---

```js
  console.log(this.state);
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Comment goes here */}
      Hello, {this.props.name}!
    </div>
  );
}
}
```

---

> Treat this.state as if it were immutable.

> Never mutate this.state directly, as calling setState() afterwards may replace the mutation you made.

> For example, you can put timer IDs directly on the instance.

> If you don't use it in render(), it shouldn't be in the state.

> The state is user-defined, and it should be a plain JavaScript object.

---

---

**Contains data specific to this component that may change over time**

---

```js
console.log(this.props);
```

---

> Contains the props that were defined by the caller of this component.

```js
render() {
```

---

> It must return one of the following types: react elements, string and numbers, portals, null or booleans.

> it does not directly interact with the browser (use lifecycle methods for this)

> It should be pure, meaning that it does not modify component state, it returns the same result each time it's invoked, and

> This method is required.

```js
componentDidCatch() { }
```

---

> Error boundaries catch errors during rendering, in lifecycle methods, and in constructors of the whole tree below them.

> Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.

```js
componentWillUnmount() { }
```

---

> Perform any necessary cleanup in this method, such as invalidating timers, canceling network requests, or cleaning up any subscriptions that were created in componentDidMount().

> Invoked immediately before a component is unmounted and destroyed.

```js
componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) { }
```

---

> This is also a good place to do network requests as long as you compare the current props to previous props (e.g. a network request may not be necessary if the props have not changed).

> Use this as an opportunity to operate on the DOM when the component has been updated.

> Invoked immediately after updating occurs. This method is not called for the initial render.

```js
componentWillUpdate(nextProps, nextState) { }
```

---

> If you need to update state in response to props changes, use componentWillReceiveProps() instead.

> (e.g. dispatch a Redux action) that would trigger an update to a React component before componentWillUpdate() returns.

> Note that you cannot call this.setState() here; nor should you do anything else

> Use this as an opportunity to perform preparation before an update occurs. This method is not called for the initial render.

> Invoked just before rendering when new props or state are being received.

```js
shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) { }
```

---

> Returning false does not prevent child components from re-rendering when their state changes.

> This method is not called for the initial render or when forceUpdate() is used.

---

---

**shouldComponentUpdate() is invoked before rendering when new props or state are being received. Defaults to true**

---

> The default behavior is to re-render on every state change, and in the vast majority of cases you should rely on the default behavior.

---

---

**^^^^ Let React know if a component's output is not affected by the current change in state or props**

---

```js
componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) { }
```

---

> If you need to update the state in response to prop changes (for example, to reset it), you may compare this.props and nextProps and perform state transitions using this.setState() in this method.

> Invoked before a mounted component receives new props.

```js
componentDidMount() { }
```

---

> This method is a good place to set up any subscriptions. If you do that, don't forget to unsubscribe in componentWillUnmount().

> If you need to load data from a remote endpoint, this is a good place to instantiate the network request.

> Initialization that requires DOM nodes should go here.

> Invoked immediately after a component is mounted.

```js
componentWillMount() { }
```

---

> This is the only lifecycle hook called on server rendering.

> Invoked just before mounting occurs (before render())

```jsx
setState(updater[, callback]) { }
```

**You may optionally pass an object as the first argument to setState() instead of a function**

---

> Instead, use componentDidUpdate or a setState callback.

> This makes reading this.state right after calling setState() a potential pitfall.

> setState() does not always immediately update the component. It may batch or defer the update until later.

> Enqueues changes to the component state and tells React that this component and its children need to be re-rendered with the updated state.

```js
    color: props.initialColor
  };
}
```

---

> If you "fork" props by using them for state, you might also want to implement componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) to keep the state up-to-date with them. But lifting state up is often easier and less bug-prone.

> This effectively "forks" the props and sets the state with the initial props.

---

---

**In rare cases, it's okay to initialize state based on props**

---

```js
  this.state = {
    active: true,
```

---

---

**The constructor is the right place to initialize state**

---

```js
this.method = this.method.bind(this);
```

> Binding makes sure the method has access to component attributes like this.props and this.state

> The constructor is also often used to bind event handlers to the class instance.

> Will be called before it is mounted constructor(props) { Call this method before any other statement or this.props will be undefined in the constructor super(props);

```js


class Component extends React.Component {
```

**You can also use it with the shorthand <>\</> syntax**

---

---

---

**The React.Fragment component lets you return multiple elements in a render() method without creating an additional DOM element**

---

```js
React.Children.toArray(children);
```

---

> Useful if you want to manipulate collections of children in your render methods, especially if you want to reorder or slice this.props.children before passing it down.

---

---

**Returns the children opaque data structure as a flat array with keys assigned to each child**

---

```js
React.Children.only(children);
```

---

> Otherwise this method throws an error.

---

---

**Verifies that children has only one child (a React element) and returns it**

---

```js
React.Children.count(children);
```

---

---

**Returns the total number of components in children, equal to the number of times that a callback passed to map or forEach would be invoked**

---

```js
React.Children.forEach(children, function[(thisArg)]);
```

---

---

**Like React.Children.map() but does not return an array**

---

```js
React.Children.map(children, function[(thisArg)]);
```

---

> Invokes a function on every immediate child contained within children with this set to thisArg.

---

---

**React.Children> provides utilities for dealing with the this.props.children opaque data structure**

---

```js
React.isValidElement(object);
```

---

---

**Verifies the object is a React element. Returns true or false**

---

```js
React.cloneElement(element, [props], [...children]);
```

---

> The resulting element will have the original element's props with the new props merged in shallowly.

---

---

**Clone and return a new React element using element as the starting point**

---

```js
React.createElement(type, [props], [...children]);
```

**You will not typically invoke React.createElement() directly if you are using JSX**

---

> Code written with JSX will be converted to use React.createElement().

> Create and return a new React element of the given type.

---

```js

```

---

---

**How many bytes will be returned when buffer.inspect() is called. This can be overridden by user modules**

---

```js
buffer.INSPECT_MAX_BYTES;
```

---

---

**The size of the buffer in bytes, Note that this is not necessarily the size of the contents**

---

```js
buf.length;
```

---

---

**Get and set the octet at index**

---

```js
buf[index];
```

---

---

**Fills the buffer with the specified value**

---

```js
buf.fill(value, [offset], [end]);
```

---

---

**Returns a new buffer which references the same memory as the old, but offset and cropped by the start (defaults to 0) and end (defaults to buffer.length) indexes. Negative indexes start from the end of the buffer**

---

```js
buf.slice([start], [end]);
```

---

---

**Does copy between buffers. The source and target regions can be overlapped**

---

---

```js
buf.copy(targetBuffer, [targetStart], [sourceStart], [sourceEnd]);
```

---

---

**Returns a JSON-representation of the Buffer instance, which is identical to the output for JSON Arrays**

---

```js
buf.toJSON();
```

---

> Decodes and returns a string from buffer data encoded with encoding (defaults to 'utf8') beginning at start (defaults to 0) and ending at end (defaults to buffer.length).

---

> buf.toString(\[encoding], \[start], \[end]);

---

---

**Writes string to the buffer at offset using the given encoding**

---

```js
buf.write(string, [offset], [length], [encoding]);
```

---

---

**Gives the actual byte length of a string**

---

```js
Buffer.byteLength(string, [encoding]);
```

---

---

**Returns a buffer which is the result of concatenating all the buffers in the list together**

---

```js
Buffer.concat(list, [totalLength]);
```

---

---

**Tests if obj is a Buffer**

---

```js
Buffer.isBuffer(obj);
```

---

---

**Returns true if the encoding is a valid encoding argument, or false otherwise**

---

```js
Buffer.isEncoding(encoding);
```

---

---

**Allocates a new buffer containing the given str. encoding defaults to 'utf8'**

---

```js
Buffer.from(str, [encoding]);
```

---

---

**Allocates a new buffer using an array of octets**

---

```js
Buffer.from(array);
```

---

---

**Allocates a new buffer of size octets**

---

```js
Buffer.from(size);
```

> Buffer is used to dealing with binary data Buffer is similar to an array of integers but corresponds to a raw memory allocation outside the V8 heap

---

---

**A constant defining the appropriate End-of-line marker for the operating system**

---

```js
os.EOL;
```

---

---

**Get a list of network interfaces**

---

---

```js
os.networkInterfaces();
```

---

**Returns an array of objects containing information about each CPU/core installed: model, speed (in MHz), and times (an object containing the number of milliseconds the CPU/core spent in: user, nice, sys, idle, and irq)**

---

```js
os.cpus();
```

---

---

**Returns the amount of free system memory in bytes**

---

**Calls message.connection.setTimeout(msecs, callback)**

---

```js

```

---

---

**The net.Socket object associated with the connection**

---

```js

```

---

> The 3-digit HTTP response status code. E.G. 404.

```js
message.statusCode;
```

---

---

**Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is present in the actual HTTP request**

---

```js
message.url;
```

---

---

**The request method as a string. Read only. Example: 'GET', 'DELETE'**

---

```js
message.method;
```

---

---

**The request/response trailers object. Only populated after the 'end' event**

---

---

```js
message.trailers;
```

---

---

**The request/response headers object**

---

```js
message.headers;
```

---

---

**In case of server request, the HTTP version sent by the client. In the case of client response, the HTTP version of the connected-to server**

---

```js
message.httpVersion;
```

---

---

**Emitted when the response has been sent**

---

---

```js
response.on("finish", function () {});
```

---

---

**Indicates that the underlying connection was terminated before response.end() was called or able to flush**

---

---

```js
response.on("close", function () {});
```

---

---

**When true, the Date header will be automatically generated and sent in the response if it is not already present in the headers. Defaults to true**

---

```js
response.sendDate;
```

---

---

**Boolean (read-only). True if headers were sent, false otherwise**

---

```js
response.headersSent;
```

---

---

**When using implicit headers (not calling response.writeHead() explicitly), this property controls the status code that will be sent to the client when the headers get flushed**

---

```js
response.statusCode;
```

---

---

**This method signals to the server that all of the response headers and body have been sent; that server should consider this message complete. The method, response.end(), MUST be called on each response**

---

```js
response.end([data], [encoding]);
```

---

---

**This method adds HTTP trailing headers (a header but at the end of the message) to the response**

---

```js
response.addTrailers(headers);
```

---

---

**Removes a header that's queued for implicit sending**

---

```js
response.removeHeader(name);
```

---

---

**Reads out a header that's already been queued but not sent to the client. Note that the name is case insensitive**

---

```js
response.getHeader(name);
```

---

---

**Sets a single header value for implicit headers. If this header already exists in the to-be-sent headers, its value will be replaced. Use an array of strings here if you need to send multiple headers with the same name**

---

```js
response.setHeader(name, value);
```

---

---

**Sets the Socket's timeout value to msecs. If a callback is provided, then it is added as a listener on the 'timeout' event on the response object**

---

```js
response.setTimeout(msecs, callback);
```

---

---

**Sends a response header to the request**

---

```js
response.writeHead(statusCode, [reasonPhrase], [headers]);
```

---

---

**Sends a HTTP/1.1 100 Continue message to the client, indicating that the request body should be sent**

---

```js
response.writeContinue();
```

---

---

**This sends a chunk of the response body. If this merthod is called and response.writeHead() has not been called, it will switch to implicit header mode and flush the implicit headers**

---

```js
response.write(chunk, [encoding]);
```

---

---

**Emitted when the server sends a '100 Continue' HTTP response, usually because the request contained 'Expect: 100-continue'. This is an instruction that the client should send the request body**

---

```js
request.on("continue", function () {});
```

---

---

**Emitted each time a server responds to a request with an upgrade. If this event isn't being listened for, clients receiving an upgrade header will have their connections closed**

---

```js
request.on("upgrade", function (response, socket, head) {});
```

---

---

**Emitted each time a server responds to a request with a CONNECT method. If this event isn't being listened for, clients receiving a CONNECT method will have their connections closed**

---

```js
request.on("connect", function (response, socket, head) {});
```

---

---

**Emitted after a socket is assigned to this request**

---

```js
request.on("socket", function (socket) {});
```

---

---

**Emitted when a response is received to this request. This event is emitted only once**

---

```js
request.on("response", function (response) {});
```

---

---

**Once a socket is assigned to this request and is connected socket.setKeepAlive() will be called**

---

```js
request.setSocketKeepAlive([enable], [initialDelay]);
```

---

---

**Once a socket is assigned to this request and is connected socket.setNoDelay() will be called**

---

```js
request.setNoDelay([noDelay]);
```

---

---

**Once a socket is assigned to this request and is connected socket.setTimeout() will be called**

---

---

```js
request.setTimeout(timeout, [callback]);
```

---

---

**Aborts a request**

---

```js
request.abort();
```

---

---

**Finishes sending the request. If any parts of the body are unsent, it will flush them to the stream**

---

```js
request.end([data], [encoding]);
```

---

---

**Sends a chunk of the body**

---

```js
request.write(chunk, [encoding]);
```

---

---

**If a client connection emits an 'error' event - it will forwarded here**

---

```js
server.on("clientError", function (exception, socket) {});
```

---

---

**Emitted each time a client requests a http upgrade**

---

```js
server.on("upgrade", function (request, socket, head) {});
```

---

---

**Emitted each time a client requests a http CONNECT method**

---

```js
server.on("connect", function (request, socket, head) {});
```

---

---

**Emitted each time a request with an http Expect: 100-continue is received**

---

---

```js
server.on("checkContinue", function (request, response) {});
```

---

---

**Emitted when the server closes**

---

---

```js
server.on("close", function () {});
```

---

---

**When a new TCP stream is established**

---

```js
server.on("connection", function (socket) {});
```

---

---

---

```js
server.on("request", function (request, response) {});
```

---

---

**The number of milliseconds of inactivity before a socket is presumed to have timed out**

---

```js
server.timeout;

---

---

**Limits maximum incoming headers count, equal to 1000 by default. If set to 0 - no limit will be applied**

---

---

```js
server.maxHeadersCount;
```

---

---

**This is useful in certain cases where a stream is being consumed by a parser, which needs to "un-consume" some data that it has optimistically pulled out of the source, so that the stream can be passed on to some other party**

---

```js
readable.unshift(chunk);
```

---

---

**This method will remove the hooks set up for a previous pipe() call. If the destination is not specified, then all pipes are removed**

---

```js
readable.unpipe([destination]);
```

---

---

**This method pulls all the data out of a readable stream, and writes it to the supplied destination, automatically managing the flow so that the destination is not overwhelmed by a fast readable stream**

---

```js
readable.pipe(destination, [options]);
```

---

---

**This method will cause a stream in flowing-mode to stop emitting data events**

---

```js
readable.pause();
```

---

---

**This method will cause the readable stream to resume emitting data events**

---

```js
readable.resume();
```

---

---

**Call this function to cause the stream to return strings of the specified encoding instead of Buffer objects**

---

```js
readable.read([size]);
readable.setEncoding(encoding);
```

---

> This method should only be called in non-flowing mode. In flowing-mode, this method is called automatically until the internal buffer is drained.

> The read() method pulls some data out of the internal buffer and returns it. If there is no data available, then it will return null.

---

---

**Emitted if there was an error receiving data**

---

---

```js
readable.on("error", function () {});
```

---

---

**Emitted when the underlying resource (for example, the backing file descriptor) has been closed. Not all streams will emit this**

---

---

```js
readable.on("close", function () {});
```

---

---

**This event fires when there will be no more data to read**

---

```js
readable.on("end", function () {});
```

---

---

**If you attach a data event listener, then it will switch the stream into flowing mode, and data will be passed to your handler as soon as it is available**

---

---

```js
readable.on("data", function (chunk) {});
```

---

---

**When a chunk of data can be read from the stream, it will emit a 'readable' event**

---

```js
let readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();
readable.on("readable", function () {});
```

---

> Examples of readable streams include: http responses on the client, http requests on the server, fs read streams zlib streams, crypto streams, tcp sockets, child process stdout and stderr, process.stdin.

> A Readable stream will not start emitting data until you indicate that you are ready to receive it.

> In other words, data comes out of a Readable stream.

> The Readable stream interface is the abstraction for a source of data that you are reading from.

> Streams are readable, writable, or both. All streams are instances of EventEmitter.

> A stream is an abstract interface implemented by various objects in Node. For example a request to an HTTP server is a stream, as is stdout.

---

---

**Return the number of listeners for a given event**

---

---

```js

---

```js
emitter.emit(event, [arg1], [arg2], [...]);
```

---

```js
emitter.listeners(event);
```

---

---

**By default EventEmitters will print a warning if more than 10 listeners are added for a particular event**

---

```js
emitter.setMaxListeners(n);
```

---

---

**Removes all listeners, or those of the specified event**

---

```js
emitter.removeAllListeners([event]);
```

---

---

**Remove a listener from the listener array for the specified event**

---

```js
emitter.removeListener(event, listener);
```

---

> Adds a one time listener for the event. This listener is invoked only the next time the event is fired, after which it is removed.

```js
emitter.once(event, listener);
```

---

---

**Same as emitter.addListener()**

---

```js
emitter.on(event, listener);
```

---

---

**Adds a listener to the end of the listeners array for the specified event**

---

```js
emitter.addListener(event, listener);
```

---

> All EventEmitters emit the event 'newListener' when new listeners are added and 'removeListener' when a listener is removed.

---

---

**To access the EventEmitter class, require('events').EventEmitter**

---

> All objects which emit events are instances of events.EventEmitter. You can access this module by doing: require("events");

#### Strings and Variables

Set a variable `test`:

```js
> var test = 'ok';
> console.log(test);
ok
```

With `var` you can overwrite the value:

```js
> var test = 'ok';
> var test = 'ok2';
> console.log(test);
ok2
```

With `const` you cannot as the value remains what it was set initially to:

```js
> const test = 'ok';
> const test = 'ok';
Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'test' has already been declared
```

String interpolation:

```js
> const name = 'ruan';
> var msg = `my name is ${name}`
> console.log(msg);
my name is ruan
```

With new line characters:

```js
> var msg = `my name is:\n- ${name}`
> console.log(msg);
my name is:
- ruan
```

---

#### IF Statements

If, else and else if:

```js
> var x = 2;
> if (x == 0) {
  console.log('x is 0');
  } else if (x > 1) {
  console.log('x is more than 1');
  } else {
  console.log('x is probably 1');
}
x is more than 1
```

If statement using multiple conditions:

```js
> var event = {'name': 'ruan', 'surname': 'bekker', 'age': 34, 'severity': 'Low', 'skip': false}
> if ((!event.skip && event.name == 'ruan')) {
  console.log('true');
}
true
```

The same as above, but adding OR:

```js
> var event = {'name': 'ruan', 'surname': 'bekker', 'age': 34, 'severity': 'Low', 'skip': false}
> if ((!event.skip && event.name == 'frank') || (!event.skip && event.age == 34)) {
  console.log('true');
}
true
```

Or it can be written like this:

```js
> var event = {'name': 'ruan', 'surname': 'bekker', 'age': 34, 'severity': 'Low', 'skip': false}
> if (!event.skip && (event.name == 'frank') || (event.age == 34)) {
  console.log('true');
}
true
```
