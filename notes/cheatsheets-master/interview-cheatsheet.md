# Tech Interview Cheat Sheet TypeScript/JavaScript Challenges

## Overview
These tests and their files are written in TypeScript, but you don't even need to know TypeScript to use them. The functions are already set up with the needed declarations. All you need to do is fill them in to make them pass the tests.

The tests are set up to fail fast, meaning as soon as one test fails no other tests after it run. This is meant to help you keep focused the current test at hand.

## Getting Started
It's really this simple!
```bash
git clone git@github.com:TSiege/Tech-Interview-Cheat-Sheet.git
